# MetaConscious Product Overview

MetaConscious is an autonomous AI planning and productivity system where the AI has **final authority** over scheduling, planning, and prioritization decisions.

## Core Philosophy

- **System Authority**: The AI makes scheduling decisions autonomously, not as suggestions
- **No Non-Negotiables**: Everything is a trade-off with explicit reasoning
- **Override Limits**: Manual changes are tracked and capped weekly (default: 5 overrides)
- **Science-Based**: Factual, confrontational tone—no generic motivation
- **Private & Self-Hosted**: Single user system, completely open source

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Planning**: Nightly AI-generated daily schedules with reasoning
- **Goal Management**: Max 3-5 active goals with priority reasoning required
- **Task Prioritization**: All tasks require explicit priority justification
- **Social Time Allocation**: Automatic time budgeting for relationships
- **Override Tracking**: Manual changes logged and limited to maintain system authority
- **Calendar Integration**: Internal events with external calendar sync (scaffolded)

## Target User

Single user seeking an AI system that makes hard decisions about time allocation rather than just providing suggestions. Users who want accountability and explicit trade-off analysis.
